            England
            is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The
            country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes
            over
            100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.</p> <br>

        <p id="secondpara"> The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper
            Paleolithic
            period, but takes
            its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula, who settled during
            the
            5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural
            and
            legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century.[9] The
            English
            language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common law legal systems of many other
            countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has
            been
            widely adopted by other nations.[10] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming
            its
            society into the world's first industrialised nation.[11]</p> <br>

        <p class="rd" id="thiRdpara"> England's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and
            southern
            England. However, there is
            upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the Lake District and Pennines) and in the west
            (for
            example, Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills). The capital is London, which has the largest metropolitan area
            in
            the United Kingdom. England's population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United
            Kingdom,[4] largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North
            West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th
            century.[12] </p>
